# CESM_postprocessing
Project repository for the CESM python based post-processing code, documentation via the wiki, and issues tracking.

The input data sets required by this code are separate from this repository. Instructions
for accessing these data sets will be coming soon. For NCAR users, the data sets are already
loaded into a central location on glade and do not need to be downloaded. 

The NCAR cheyenne and geyser quick start guide along with other documentation is available at:

http://github.com/NCAR/CESM_postprocessing/wiki/

A NCAR/CGD mailman listserv is available by user subscription to convey information to NCAR machine users
regarding the build status of common postprocessing python virtualenvs on cheyenne and geyser.

To subscribe:

http://mailman.cgd.ucar.edu/mailman/listinfo/cesm_postprocessing

To post a message to all the list members, send email to cesm_postprocessing@cgd.ucar.edu.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The purpose of the mailman listserv is to inform NCAR machine users about the build status
of the common virtualenv's on cheyenne and geyser. 

All bug reports and enhancement requests should be posted in this github repo issues and not via the mailman listserv.
