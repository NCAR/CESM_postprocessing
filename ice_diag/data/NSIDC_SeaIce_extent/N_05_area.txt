Important Notes: 1) The "extent" column includes the area near the pole not
imaged by the sensor. It is assumed to be entirely ice covered with at	least
15% concentration. However, the "area" column excludes the area not  imaged by
the sensor. This area is 1.19 million square kilometers for SMMR  (from the
beginning of the series through June 1987) and 0.31 million  square kilometers
for SSM/I (from July 1987 to present). Therefore, there  is a discontinuity in
the "area" data values in this file at the June/July  1987 boundary. 2) When
insufficient satellite data is available to process the area and extent values,
the data is flagged as -9999. For more information see Processing Steps,
Monthly Mean Ice Concentration in the documentation -
