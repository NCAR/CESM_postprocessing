UPDATE 09/13/2011

These are scripts to take the ice diagnostics plots and make them available
for a web page. Note that these are now merged into a single script now called:

setup_ice_plots.csh

and make use of a number of new web template files:

index_temp.html and index_diff_temp.html
contour.html and contour_diff.html
regional.html and regional_diff.html
timeseries.html and timeseries_diff.html
vector.html and vector_diff.html.

The main change is the user turns on or off the difference plots with the
variable DIFF_PLOTS in setup_ice_web.csh. Otherwise, the script runs very 
similarly to diff_plots.csh or all_plots.csh.

The older versions are still available. Here is a quick summary of the files:

These are the new CICE diagnostics with four seasons. The label 'all_plots'
refers to a single case versus observations, while 'diff_plots' is for a
comparison of two cases. The csh script generates the directory tree
and untars everything from the all_plots.tar or diff_plots.tar created by
the diagnostics package. The html files are simply templates that the csh
script uses to set up the top-level page. You need to modify the BASE_DIR
in the csh script so the plots go in the right place.

all_plots.csh
all_plots.html
diff_plots.csh
diff_plots.html

These are still the new diagnostics with four seasons, but if you ran the
new diagnostic package with CCSM3 (CSIM) output, then you can display the
images using the following.

all_plots_csim.csh
all_plots_csim.html
diff_plots_csim.csh
diff_plots_csim.html

The old diagnostics with only two seasons. Use these if you have an older
verson of the ice diagnostics package with CCSM3 (CSIM) output.

all_plots_old.csh
all_plots_old.html
diff_plots_old.csh
diff_plots_old.html
