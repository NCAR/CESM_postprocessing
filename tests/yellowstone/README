This directory contains the tests that should be run on NCAR's Yellowstone
compute system.  The general order of operations is described below:

0) Analyze Test Input:

   mkstats.py: Generate statistics describing the test input files.  This
                writes the test statistics to the 'teststats.json' file.
                
1) Run Tests

   runtests.py: Run any number of selected tests in serial or in parallel,
                submitted to a queue.  This can use a single Specifier,
                or multiple Specifiers, for each PyReshaper job.
                    
2) Check Test Results

   checkresults.py: Compare output from each test that has been run against
                    accepted results (found in /glade/u/tdd/asap/bakeoff)
                    
3) Get Timing Data

   mktimings.py: Read the PyReshaper output for each test that has been run
                  and extract the timing data from the output logs.  Add this
                  timing data to the 'timings.json' database.
                  
4) Make Plots

   mkplots.py: Creates typical timing and throughput plots from information
               found in the 'timings.json' database.
